Step by step instructions:

1. Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/
2. Create a new Project Directory
3. Initialise Project by running the following command "npm init -y"
4. Installed Express using npm by running the following Command "npm install express"
5. We create a HTML file 
6. Create server.js file which will contain the express server code.
7. Next, We wrote the code for Express server in server.js file. In this file we configured express to serve the static files from our html file.
8. We then start the server using the following command "node server.js"
9. After starting the server using the command "node server.js", the terminal will display a message indicating that the server is running. Usually, it will display something like "Server running on port 8080" (assuming we configured Express to listen on port 8080).
10. To access the website served by our Express server, we open a web browser and navigate to the following URL: http://localhost:8080. On opening the link we will see the contents of our HTML file.
